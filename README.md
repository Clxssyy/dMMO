# dMMO

**_dMMO_** is a [Discord](discord.com) bot that tracks user activity such as messaging, reacting, and much more in a gamified [MMORPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_role-playing_game) format.

## Features

### Skills

Everyday activities users are already doing on the daily.

- **Messaging**: send a message inside any channel
- **Reacting**: add a reaction to any message that **isn't** your own or a bots
- **Editing**: edit any of your messages
- **Cleaning**: delete any of your own messages
- **Discussion**: send a message inside of any thread

#### Leveling

To level skills, simply perform one of the given actions for some experience. With each level this process becomes slightly harder.

> [!NOTE]
> Experience can only be gained once per action and has a 1m cooldown to help prevent spamming.

### Quests

Set tasks to promote specific activity within your server.

> [!TIP]
> Some quests provide small boosts in experience to speed up leveling.

### Events

Create events around important times within your server.

> [!TIP]
> Some events can provide unique buffs for short periods of time.

### Reputation System

Similar to skills, but allows for users to track interactions. Instead of performing actions, users gain reputation when others interact with messages, events, and threads they create. Some examples of how a user might gain rep are:

- A user reacts to a message you sent.
- A user joins / is interested in an event you created.
- A user sends a message in a thread you created.

> [!NOTE]
> Reputation works similar to skills experience, but there is a 10m cooldown per user you interact with.

### Custom User Profiles

Show off your dedication within a server through unique titles, backgrounds, etc.

### Leaderboards

Climb various leaderboards covering different timeframes and skills.

> [!NOTE]
> Daily, weekly, and monthly leaderboards provide rewards for the top 10 people.

### Slash Commands

- `/leaderboard (type?)` - Display a the top 10 users (default type: total level)
- `/stats (user?)` - Display a user's stats (default: user who sent command)
- `/bot` - Display the bot's info
